_OVERVIEW_
Initially, this will be mostly to manage the various bots as part of a user's profile, track their win/loss/draw, and allow for 
organizing battles with different players.  Eventually, I'd like to build some meta-game into this to make it more interesting

The idea is that players will be able to select others for matches, pick which bot(s) they want to battle.  Then configure things like 
order (dont remember off-hand if pmars supports this), cycles til tie, memory space, version and other pmars options.  The battle will 
then be run and results collected and attributed to varios bots. 

_DATABASE_

CREATE TABLE users (
id SERIAL,
username varchar(50),
password varchar(50),
email varchar(50),
admin integer default 0
);

CREATE TABLE warriors (
id SERIAL,
name varchar(50),
version integer,
owner integer,
notes text,
code text
);

CREATE TABLE battle (
id SERIAL,
rounds integer default 1,
core_size integer default 8000,
tie_cycles integer default 80000,
max_size integer default 100,
min_distance integer default 0,
battle_time integer,
);

CREATE TABLE battle_has_warrior (
id SERIAL, 
battleid integer,
warriorid integer,
position integer, -- to indicate what order the bots go in, this is 1-based, rather than zero
);

CREATE TABLE battle_has_result (
id SERIAL,
battleid integer, 
warriorid integer,
score integer,  -- value computed by pmars for overall effectiveness of all rounds, useless tho without the other infos
win integer,
draw integer,
loss integer
);

_MECHANICS_

This will certainly need to be expanded on.  

Players will be able to upload redcode scripts that will be stored in the warriors table.  Updating a bot can be stored by usign the 
same name and a newer version.  Battles will be logged in battle_results and considerations should be made for multiple (more than 2) 
player/bot battles.  Initially, this might just be 1v1 support.
