_OVERVIEW_

Initially, this will be mostly to manage the various bots as part of a user's profile, track their win/loss/draw, and allow for 
organizing battles with different players.  Eventually, I'd like to build some meta-game into this to make it more interesting


_DATABASE_

CREATE TABLE users (
id SERIAL,
username varchar(50),
password varchar(50),
email varchar(50)
);

CREATE TABLE warriors (
id SERIAL,
name varchar(50),
version integer,
owner integer,
notes text,
code text
);

CREATE TABLE battle_results (
id SERIAL,
battle_time integer
);
-- need to suss out how to track the win/loss/draw along with what players/bots are involved
-- also need a way to track pmars config

_MECHANICS_

This will certainly need to be expanded on.  

Players will be able to upload redcode scripts that will be stored in the warriors table.  Updating a bot can be stored by usign the 
same name and a newer version.  Battles will be logged in battle_results and considerations should be made for multiple (more than 2) 
player/bot battles.  Initially, this might just be 1v1 support.
