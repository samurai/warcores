_OVERVIEW_
Initially, this will be mostly to manage the various bots as part of a user's profile, track their win/loss/draw, and allow for 
organizing battles with different players.  Eventually, I'd like to build some meta-game into this to make it more interesting

The idea is that players will be able to select others for matches, pick which bot(s) they want to battle.  Then configure things like 
order (dont remember off-hand if pmars supports this), cycles til tie, memory space, version and other pmars options.  The battle will 
then be run and results collected and attributed to varios bots. 

_DATABASE_

CREATE TABLE users (
id SERIAL,
username varchar(50),
password varchar(50),
email varchar(50),
admin integer default 0
);

CREATE TABLE warriors (
id SERIAL,
name varchar(50),
version integer,
owner integer,
notes text,
code text
);

CREATE TABLE battle_results (
id SERIAL,
battle_time integer
);
-- need to suss out how to track the win/loss/draw along with what players/bots are involved
-- also need a way to track pmars config

CREATE TABLE player_has_battle (
id SERIAL,
playerid integer,
playernumber integer,  -- this one will track which order the players started in, allowing for more than 2 player matches?
gameid integer,
botid integer
);

_MECHANICS_

This will certainly need to be expanded on.  

Players will be able to upload redcode scripts that will be stored in the warriors table.  Updating a bot can be stored by usign the 
same name and a newer version.  Battles will be logged in battle_results and considerations should be made for multiple (more than 2) 
player/bot battles.  Initially, this might just be 1v1 support.
